# TheBetterNormal
**TheBetterNormal is a crowdsourced web application to formulate and share your individual hopes for the future, and visualize our hopes on a collective scale.**
This project is currently in the Prototype 1 phase - a precursor to the final crowdsourced platform that utilizes a simple form interface to collect long-form text input. The aim is to get a better understanding of the way that people express their hopes and how they feel when they see the hopes of others.
